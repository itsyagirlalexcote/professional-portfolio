## My process

This is a second portfolio after originally creating an MVP previously. I wanted to make a portfolio that was in line with current design standards and with a cleaner aesthetic. I researched several current developer portfolios to determine which features I wanted to incorporate in my new portfolio and learn how to code these new features at the same time. 

I began by sketching what I wanted my page to look like on paper along with some notes on its basic functions. I moved the sketches to Figma to make a design comp and I wanted to begin learning some basics of prototyping using Figma. I turned to one of my mentors to get some advice and insight on my process as well as some pointers on my use of Figma.

Once the Design Comp was made, I created a new repo using Git and Github. I organized the new file and began coding the structure of my site in the index.html file in VS Code. I continued by styling the site and adding a few basic JavaScript features and animations simply to bring my portfolio to life while showcasing the basics of my skillset. Some freestyle coding was used as I went along and changed my mind while previewing. 

Finally, I tested all parts of the portfolio and send it to my mentor and other peers for a final review and to obtain final comments and feedback before publishing the final product.

### What I learned

The last time I made a portfolio I did not make a proper design comp first and just this step greatly helped in organizing my work. I also learned the basics of Figma by taking the time to do this step. 

I learned more about using animations and challenged myself to create animations that I had never used before. 

I learned more about making clean and simple designs that feel more user friendly. This boosted my confidence as a developer as some of my previous projects were properly coded but were not as aethetically pleasing or centered on user-friendliness.
