## Introduction

Professional Portfolio website showcasing Projects, Skills and an About section.

## My process

This portfolio represents an iterative development process, building upon a previously created MVP. My goal was to align the design with current trends and achieve a cleaner aesthetic. Through research on contemporary developer portfolios, I identified features to integrate while simultaneously learning how to code them.

The development process began with paper sketches outlining the desired layout and core functionalities. I then transitioned these sketches to Figma, creating a design comp and utilizing the opportunity to learn basic prototyping within the tool. Throughout this phase, I sought guidance from a mentor regarding my approach and Figma usage.

Upon finalizing the design comp, I set up a new Git repository on GitHub and began structuring the site's HTML in VS Code. Styling followed, along with the implementation of basic JavaScript features and animations to enhance user experience and showcase my skillset. I embraced an "exploratory coding" approach, adapting and adding new functionalities as inspiration struck. This project heavily emphasized learning; I remained open to any adjustments or improvements that emerged throughout development.

The final stage involved thorough testing of all portfolio functionalities. I then shared it with my mentor and peers for final review and feedback before deployment. This iterative review process proved time-consuming due to my self-directed design approach, ensuring all stylistic elements aligned with user expectations and professional standards.

### Major Functions

- Content Display:
    - Projects: This section showcases a list of projects worked on. It includes descriptions, screenshots, and links to live demos.
    - Skills: This section highlights technical skills and expertise. It lists programming languages, frameworks, tools, and other relevant abilities.
    - About: This section provides a brief introduction about background and experience. It includes educational background, work history, and a personal statement.
    - Contact: This section offers ways for potential employers or clients to get in touch. It includes an email address and social media profiles.
  
- Navigation:
    - Hamburger Menu: This is a collapsible menu  represented by three horizontal lines stacked vertically. It provides easy access to all the main sections of the portfolio by expanding to reveal a list of       navigation links when clicked.
  
-  User Interface:
    - Dark Mode: This function allows users to switch between a light-colored theme and a dark-colored theme for the portfolio. A dark mode improves readability in low-light conditions and can be visually appealing to some users.
   
In essence, the portfolio's functionalities focus on presenting work experience, skills, and contact information in a user-friendly and visually appealing way. The hamburger menu and dark mode features enhance the user experience by making the portfolio easier to navigate and customize.

### What I learned

  - Key Learnings & Skill Development:

    - Design Process Optimization: This iteration emphasized the importance of a design comp. Creating a Figma comp upfront significantly improved my workflow and organization compared to my previous portfolio. It also provided a valuable opportunity to learn basic Figma prototyping.

    - Animation Techniques: I actively challenged myself by incorporating new and more complex animations into the portfolio. This process honed my understanding of animation principles and their implementation.

    - User-Centered Design: A significant focus was placed on crafting clean and user-friendly interfaces. This project instilled a stronger appreciation for the importance of user experience (UX) in development. Prior projects, while functionally sound, lacked attention to aesthetics and user interaction.

    - Dark Mode Implementation: I expanded my skillset by implementing a dark mode feature, including the styling aspects I hadn't previously addressed. This process involved researching WCAG compliance to ensure accessibility.
    
    - Problem-Solving & Resourcefulness: Integrating new features and styles fostered significant growth in my problem-solving abilities. I honed my research skills by utilizing resources like Chat GPT prompts and targeted Google searches to find efficient solutions.
