## My process

This is a second portfolio after originally creating an MVP previously. I wanted to make a portfolio that was in line with current design standards and with a cleaner aesthetic. I researched several current developer portfolios to determine which features I wanted to incorporate in my new portfolio and learn how to code these new features at the same time. 

I began by sketching what I wanted my page to look like on paper along with some notes on its basic functions. I moved the sketches to Figma to make a design comp and I wanted to begin learning some basics of prototyping using Figma. I turned to one of my mentors to get some advice and insight on my process as well as some pointers on my use of Figma.

Once the Design Comp was made, I created a new repo using Git and Github. I organized the new file and began coding the structure of my site in the index.html file in VS Code. I continued by styling the site and adding a few basic JavaScript features simply to bring my portfolio to life while showcasing the basics of my skillset.
